# Examples

* `dynamic_rnn.py`: simple Tensorflow example showing how to specify metadata and collect metrics.

* `SU2.sh` and `SU2.py`: collect metrics, metadata and files from a C++ application, in this case a simple example using the SU2 multiphysics simulation and design software.

* `logging-to-simvue.py`: demonstrates how to configure the Python logging module to send logs to Simvue.
